Things I am working on at the moment...

---------------------------

**CyberSecLab** - *Terraform, Ansible and Python scripts for an offensive security lab  in AWS* 

Inspired by [Rob](https://github.com/rastating) and his [Shiva](https://github.com/rastating/shiva) project to automatically create an attack ready ubuntu host, I decided to expand on the concept and automate the deployment of not only an attack host, but an environment where you can perform all manner of cyber-sec activities from anywhere you choose has an internet connection. Activities such as:

* Windows Malware Analysis.
* Exploit Development
* CTFs
* OS, Tool and Technique Exploration

### Others

* [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/) - To support my PWK/OSCP course and generally sharpen those offensive security skills I have been working through some of the machines on here.
* [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) - More sharpening of skills, but with challenges to test a particular area as well such as RE, crypto etc.
