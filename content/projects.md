This is a home for Projects I am working on that I can talk about.

---------------------------

**[CyberSecLab](/cyberseclab)** *Terraform, Ansible and Python scripts for an offensive security lab in AWS*

**[Others](/others)** *Links to resources I use in sharpening and enhancing my Offensive security skills when I am in between projects.*

---------------------------

*NOTE: As I have been a contractor for most of my professional career; my work, its derivations and offshoots have generally been under NDA or IP restrictions. By the time I am allowed to share them, they are often outdated, outmoded or I have just moved on from where I was when they were a thing to me so they arent included here.*
