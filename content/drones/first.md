For my birthday this year, my wife bought me a Drone to help me get into the hobby, the chosen beast was [The Mambo FPV](https://www.parrot.com/uk/drones/parrot-mambo-fpv).

Unboxing and getting it setup was fairly straight forward. The battery comes pre-charged to around 60% and thats enough for a quick first flight... and crash!!!!

Damn! getting your head around the controls is hard for a newbie.

Everything about flying a drone is co-ordination. the left stick controls the Z-Axis, movement up and down is via the **Throttling** up and down on the left stick, Rotation about the Z-Axis, **Yaw**, is left and right on the left stick.

Going forwards is done via the **Pitch** on the right stick, forwards and back are fairly intuitive. Your 4th and final control plane is the **Roll**, left and right on the right stick. The roll of your drone is just like strafing. 

Combine these planes together and you can fly your drone, and as with all things *Practice makes perfect!*. I need alot more practice before taking the next step and getting one these FPV kits from the likes of UnMannedTech but it will happen. I have had so much fun with it so far just flying it around the house, I can't wait to take the training wheels off and go outside. The Mambo, however is poor in the wind so taking it outside means that your control (even when you can move the thing in 3 dimensions without your brain melting) is next to nothing in anything above a draft. Maybe when my back garden is sorted the fact its fairly insulated from the wind may mean I can take it out, only a couple of weeks to go before we have that experiment to discuss.

The web is awash with sites that talk about taking that first step, and it seems like there is an even split between folk like me; who get a cheapish drone to just go for it with crashes and all, and those who spend that startup capital on a quality R/C transmitter like a Taranis Q-X7 and hook it up to a sim.

I cant really give the pro's and con's of either technique as I have gone down the beginner drone route only for now, and its paid/paying off for me. There is nothing like the giddy squeeling of a 2 and 6 year old as a mini-drone swoops by and into the wall.... When its time for a upgrade, I reckon I may stagger it with a 'ranis and sim before I go full on with a kit.
