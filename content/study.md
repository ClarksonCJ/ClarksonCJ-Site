---------------------------

Here is a list of the materials I have or am studying.

---------------------------

### Course

* [Penetration Testing With Kali](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-training/penetration-testing-training-kali-linux/) (In Progress)
    * The precursor course to the [OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional/) examination. Its very difficult to put into words how much I have learned from this course so far, and there is always more to learn **#TryHarder**.
* [Certified Ethical Hacker](https://www.eccouncil.org/programs/certified-ethical-hacker-ceh/) (Completed)
    * An excellent introduction to the ways a hacker works to compromise a system.
* [Computer Hacking Forensics Investigator](https://www.eccouncil.org/programs/computer-hacking-forensic-investigator-chfi/) (Completed)
    * A very insightful course into art of computer forensics and the techniques that are used to catch hackers. Very interesting to take the knowledge gained here and work out ways to evade them, excellent course to take that stage further and develop the adversarial mindset.
* [CISSP](https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP) (Completed)
    * The Gold standard for information security professionals, I would advise anybody working in IT Security to do this course. Its benefit lies in understanding, as a techie I gained a deeper understanding and appreciation of how the Policy and process side of Security works.

### Sites

* [Azeria Labs](https://azeria-labs.com/)
    * Taking the plunge into (Dis)Assembly, Exploit Development and Reverse Engineering. Blossoming interest in RE on ARM devices mainly because they are EVERYWHERE, Mobile Phones, Tablets, IoT devices etc. In my opinion the future of Cyber Security will be in these devices; both as things to defend, and also to deploy in an offensive capacity.
