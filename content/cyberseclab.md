Inspired by [Rob](https://github.com/rastating) and his [Shiva](https://github.com/rastating/shiva) project to automatically create an attack ready ubuntu host, I decided to expand on the concept and automate the deployment of not only an attack host, but an environment where you can perform all manner of cyber-sec activities from anywhere you choose has an internet connection. Activities such as:

* Windows Malware Analysis.
* Exploit Development
* CTFs
* OS, Tool and Technique Exploration
