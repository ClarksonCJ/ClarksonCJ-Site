So, firstly I want to start with an apology. I relaunched the site back in October 2019 but then it went dark, no content, no updates, nothing. Well it turned out at the time that my Dad's illness (throat Cancer) had taken a major turn for the worse, and we were told that there was only one outcome remaining.

He had an operation in October to attempt to remove the lymph nodes that the cancer had metastacised into but because of how far it had spread into his neck, that was impossible. This then led to a series of hospital admissions, and a general deterioration of his health to the point where at one point we feared he wouldnt make it to Christmas. However, he bounced back a little and spent his final Christmas with the family and his beloved grandkids.

We lost him at the end of January 2019, but not after he managed to spend some quality time with the family throughout January (his best spell of health in around 6 months). It appeared to everyone that he had a list he was working through, and when that was done he left us and went to rest. He went peacefully in his sleep, and for this we are eternally thankful. There are many that suffer the cancer shitshow and it was a stroke of luck that he didnt.

As you can imagine, this hit all of us very hard. I have found it difficult to get myself back on track, and pushing on towards my goals. The first half of 2019 has been a shitshow, but with the support of my amazing family I am getting back into the swing of things, re-sighting those goals and driving on as hard as before to achieve them.

All in all, it has made me think long and hard about what I want and how I want it. As much as I want to further my career in InfoSec and all of the skills and experiences that will come along with it; I must not push for that to the exclusion of all else. Family, friends, hobbies, and downtime are as important as training, practice, and development. Without a way to vent your frustrations, a shoulder to cry on or a way to just switch off, you will burn out and fall apart before you even get to take that ever important first step into a new world never mind any others.

To that end, I have embarked on a new hobby. I have always been in awe at people who can fly drones, whether it be racing or just getting spectacular footage doing freestyle tricks etc. I decided that I wanted to be one too. So after my wife bought me a beginner drone to get started with, I have taken up freestyle FPV drone piloting as a hobby. Hoping to stop crashing it as often soon, and will get some footage out on youtube when I have some.

To finish with, I would like to thank my magnificent wife Alex who, without her constant love and support I dont think I would have made it through the past few years intact; My family (Mum, Sister and extended) for their love and support too even while they are going through their own grief; Stu and Iwan, who took time out of their own lives to support me at the funeral, and as always Xav and Aurora, who are just awesome and never fail to make me smile regardless of whatever else I have going on.

Rest In Peace Dad! you are missed by us all, but we take your drive and energy with use everyday and make the best of it!
